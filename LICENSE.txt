Thaumic Horizons' conditions of use in modpacks are based on Thaumcraft's own:

1. Your mod pack must link to this forum post.
2. You cannot directly profit off of the mod pack - although streaming videos are fine and even encouraged.
3. You cannot claim ownership of the mod or any of its elements.
4. Please let me know when you add Thaumic Horizons to any publicly-available mod pack.

5. I reserve the right to alter, remove, or add any conditions for good reasons or on a random whim.
